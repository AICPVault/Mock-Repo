Day 3: Loops and Iteration
=========================

Today we'll learn about loops - one of the most powerful concepts in programming.
Loops allow us to repeat code multiple times, making our programs more efficient
and capable of handling repetitive tasks.

Learning Objectives:
- Understand the concept of loops and iteration
- Master for loops and while loops
- Learn about loop control (break, continue, pass)
- Practice nested loops
- Build programs that can handle repetitive tasks
- Understand when to use each type of loop

Let's dive into the world of loops!

Loops are programming constructs that allow us to:
- Repeat code multiple times
- Process collections of data
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Make programs more efficient
- Handle dynamic data processing

Types of loops in Python:
- for loops: iterate over sequences
- while loops: repeat while condition is true

# 7. LOOP BEST PRACTICES

print("\nüí° LOOP BEST PRACTICES")
print("-" * 25)

print("""
Best practices for writing loops:

1. Use for loops when you know the number of iterations
2. Use while loops when you need to repeat until a condition is met
3. Always ensure your while loop has a way to terminate
4. Use meaningful variable names for loop counters
5. Avoid infinite loops unless absolutely necessary
6. Use break and continue judiciously
7. Consider using enumerate() when you need both index and value
8. Use list comprehensions for simple transformations (Day 5)
9. Keep loop bodies simple and readable
10. Test your loops with edge cases (empty lists, zero iterations)

Common loop mistakes and how to avoid them:

1. Infinite loops
   ‚ùå while True:  # No exit condition
   ‚úÖ while condition:  # Always have an exit condition

2. Off-by-one errors
   ‚ùå for i in range(1, 5):  # Might miss the last element
   ‚úÖ for i in range(1, 6):  # Check your range carefully

3. Modifying list while iterating
   ‚ùå for item in my_list:
         my_list.remove(item)  # Dangerous!
   ‚úÖ for item in my_list.copy():  # Use a copy

4. Not initializing variables
   ‚ùå for i in range(5):
         total += i  # total not initialized
   ‚úÖ total = 0
       for i in range(5):
           total += i

5. Using break/continue incorrectly
   ‚ùå if condition:
         break  # break only works in loops
   ‚úÖ for item in items:
         if condition:
             break
